# Data Link Layer

Layer 2, also known as the data link layer, is the second layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for the reliable transfer of data between two nodes on the same network segment. This layer defines protocols for the access and use of the physical network, such as addressing, flow control, and error detection and correction.
