# What is OSI model?

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) **Reference** model is a conceptual framework that describes the functions and interactions of computer systems in a network. It is divided into seven layers, with each layer responsible for specific functions in data transmission.

1. Physical Layer
2. Data-Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Applications Layer

One point to note, while discussing about a device in particular layer, that basically means that it uses all the layers below it, Physical layer being the most basic one and Application being the last.

Note: OSI Model is never implemented in real life, and hence it's a reference model only for understanding how computer network works. The real world works on TCP/IP model.
