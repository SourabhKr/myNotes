# What is networking?

Networking facilitates communication between two or more devices, nowadays even with one device(while running multiple VMs or containers).

## What is OSI model?

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework that describes the functions and interactions of computer systems in a network. It is divided into seven layers, with each layer responsible for specific functions in data transmission.

1. Physical Layer
2. Data-Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Applications Layer

One point to note, while discussing about a device in particular layer, that basically means that it uses all the layers below it, Physical layer being the most basic one and Application being the last.
