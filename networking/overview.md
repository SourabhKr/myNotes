# What is networking?

Networking facilitates communication between two or more devices, nowadays even with one device(while running multiple VMs or containers).

## What are protocols?

## Half Vs Full Duplex Communication

Half Duplex: Can send and receive data, but not at the same time.
Full Duplex: Can send and receive data simultaneously.

## Network Transmission types

How devices communicate in a network:

1. Unicast (1:1)
2. Multicast (1: Multicast group)
3. Broadcast (1:All)

## Network Topologies

### Wired Network Topology

- Bus

    All devices connected to a single coaxial network cable.Only one end device can be active on the network at a time.  

- Ring
  
  Each device in the network is connected with two other devices, making a circle. Each device also works as a repeater, where it has to forward the data not intended for itself.  
 Usually have to have 2 NICs to connect to two different devices.  

- Star

 Most used wired network topology. A single switch is connected to all the devices in the network. And hence switch also being the single point of failure.

- Mesh

    Each device is connected to every other device by separate cabling.  

  - Partial Mesh
  - Full Mesh

### Wireless Network Topology

- Adhoc

 Peer to peer wireless network where no access point(WAP) infrastructure exits.

- Infrastructure

    One wireless network access point which connects to other devices in the network wirelessly at the same time connecting to the wired network.

- Mesh

    More than one wireless access point, and these wireless access points are connected to each other. Providing extended wireless coverage.
