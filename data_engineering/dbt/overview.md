# What is DBT?

DBT is a tool, build to ease the problem of data transformation and add software principles overall. It provides high
level abstraction to the data transformation process and allows to write SQL queries in a modular way.

Below are some advantages of DBT.

| Handle boilerplate code to materialize queries as relations | For each model you create, you can easily configure a materialization. A materialization represents a build strategy for your select query â€“ the code behind a materialization is robust, boilerplate SQL that wraps your select query in a statement to create a new, or update an existing, relation.

| Use a code compiler                                         | SQL files can contain Jinja, a lightweight templating language. Using Jinja in SQL provides a way to use control structures in your queries. For example, if statements and for loops. It also enables repeated SQL to be shared through macros.

| Determine the order of model execution                      | Often, when transforming data, it makes sense to do so in a staged approach. dbt provides a mechanism to implement transformations in stages through the ref function. Rather than selecting from existing tables and views in your warehouse, you can select from another model.                                                                                  |
| Document your dbt project                                   | In dbt Cloud, you can auto-generate the documentation when your dbt project runs. dbt provides a mechanism to write, version-control, and share documentation for your dbt models. You can write descriptions (in plain text or markdown) for each model and field. Read more about the Documentation.                                                             |
| Test your models                                            | Tests provide a way to improve the integrity of the SQL in each model by making assertions about the results generated by a model. Build, test, and run your project with a button click or by using the dbt Cloud IDE command bar. Read more about writing tests for your models Testing.                                                                         |
| Manage packages                                             | dbt ships with a package manager, which allows analysts to use and publish both public and private repositories of dbt code which can then be referenced by others. Read more about Package Management.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Load seed files                                             | Often in analytics, raw values need to be mapped to a more readable value (for example, converting a country-code to a country name) or enriched with static or infrequently changing data. These data sources, known as seed files, can be saved as a CSV file in your project and loaded into your data warehouse using the seed command. Read more about Seeds. |
| Snapshot data                                               | Often, records in a data source are mutable, in that they change over time. This can be difficult to handle in analytics if you want to reconstruct historic values. dbt provides a mechanism to snapshot raw data for a point in time, through use of snapshots.                                                                                                  |
