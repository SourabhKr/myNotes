# What is docker?

Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily create, deploy and run applications in isolated environments called Containers. Containers are lightweight, portable and self contained packages that contains all the dependent binaries, libraries and configuration file needed to run an application.

Main components of docker:

1. Image: A collection of binaries and libraries that make the application.
2. Container: A running instance of the image. Multiple containers can be based out of one image. A container only runs till the time the command which was triggered while the container was starting runs.
3. Registry: A collection of images. It's similar to github for code.
