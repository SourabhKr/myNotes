# What is BigQuery Data Transfer Service?

The BigQuery Data Transfer Service automates data movement into BigQuery on a scheduled, managed basis. After
configuring a data transfer, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service automatically loads data into BigQuery on a regular
basis. Data back-fills can be initiated to recover from any outages or gaps. BigQuery Data Transfer Service can't be
used to transfer data out of BigQuery.

In addition to loading data into BigQuery, BigQuery Data Transfer Service is used for two BigQuery operations: dataset
copies and scheduled queries.

Like BigQuery, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service is a multi-regional resource, with many additional single regions
available.
