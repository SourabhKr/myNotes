# Billing

---
The billing in GCP is handled on the Organizational level by a separate Cloud Billing account within the Organization. This gives the flexibility to have multiple projects having single billing account together with the flexibility of the granular level cost monitoring.

Note: Each project must be enabled in one of the Billing accounts of the organization in order to create/use any of the GCP service-level resources in that project.
