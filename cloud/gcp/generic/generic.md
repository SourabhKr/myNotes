There are two kinds of Google Cloud APIs:

1. Resource-based APIs, which use the project associated with the resources being accessed for billing and quota,
2. Client-based APIs, which use the project associated with the account accessing the resources for billing and quota.

When you use Google Account credentials with a client-based API, the default project associated with the account can't
be used for billing purposes.
